## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. install [SourceIO](https://github.com/REDxEYE/SourceIO) plug-in into blender - this is required
1. Place [BSPImporter.dll](https://github.com/epicEaston197/RepoName/releases/latest/download/BSPImporter.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.

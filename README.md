# BSPImporter

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that will allow you to import bsp files in Neos without it crashing.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Make sure neos recognizes your blender installation ([more info here](https://wiki.neos.com/3D_Model_Import#Blender))
1. Install [SourceIO](https://github.com/REDxEYE/SourceIO) addon into blender - **this is required**
1. Place [BSPImporter.dll](https://github.com/epicEaston197/BSPImporter/releases/latest/download/BSPImporter.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
